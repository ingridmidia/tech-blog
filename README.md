# Tech Blog

## Description
This is a CMS-style blog, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This application uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. Bootstrap is used in the blog design.

If you want to use the blog you can sign up or use the test user (username: test and password: 12345678).
